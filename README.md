💡 **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**

This repository is a curated collection of **mini-projects**, **code samples**, and **practice problems** that demonstrate all the major concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**.  
Ideal for students and developers looking to learn, revise, or master OOP fundamentals.

## 🧠 Covered OOP Concepts

- 🔐 **Encapsulation** — Bundling data with methods inside a class  
- 🧼 **Abstraction** — Hiding internal complexity and exposing only what’s necessary  
- 🧬 **Inheritance** — Deriving properties and behaviors from a base class  
- 🎭 **Polymorphism** — Performing tasks in multiple ways (Function Overriding / Overloading)  
- 🔑 **Access Specifiers** — `private`, `public`, `protected` scope control

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- ✅ Small Code Samples for Each Concept  
- 🧱 Class Structure Illustrations  
- 📝 Practice Problems for Hands-On Learning  
- 🧪 Mini OOP-Based Programs to Test Understanding
